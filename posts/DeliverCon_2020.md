## Delivery Managers from all across government sharing knowledge and making connections

I was fortunate enough to snag a ticket to DeliverCon 2020, the conference for Delivery Managers within government.

On the 26 February over 100 Delivery  Managers gathered in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, from a wide range of cities  and organisations. We had almost everything we needed - a great venue,  great people, the only thing we were lacking were unconference topics to discuss for a full day together. So what did we do all day?

## **The Unconference Sessions**

Following an energiser to pick out the unconference topics based on "what would you discuss here today if you  were 100x bolder?", we moved into 4 separate spaces to discuss the top  rated ideas which ranged from communities of practice, to poor performance, to wellbeing and beyond. These happened over 5 time slots,  enabling mixing between groups and the chance for everyone to discuss a  number of ideas that they were passionate about.

## **Lightning Talks**

Lightning talks offered the  opportunity for 6 Delivery Managers from all levels of experience to  present their views on anything that has influenced them during their  time as a Delivery Manager. We heard views from across the delivery  sphere. The full list was:

- A healthy approach to risk on agile projects, Steve Parks - Convivio 
- A guilty feminist, Chloe Thompson - HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)
- The Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Fast Stream & why I'm choosing to be a  Delivery Manager, Myles Jarvis - DDaT Fast Stream
- Alpha Alpha, Julie Guthrie - National Archives
- Making a dysfunctional team into a high value team, Timi Awodipe - HMRC
- Complexity & Cynefin for Delivery Managers, Xander Harrison - Government Digital Service 

There were some fantastic takeaways  from this and things which I know Delivery Managers are already  implementing in their day to day role. Whether this is using a risk  radar to visualise how they might impact the project, how to get a Fast Streamer into a delivery role, to how they might analyse the type of  complexity in their delivery to work out the best approach to learning  about and solving it.

## **Finally, a retro**

An event full of Delivery Managers  would not be complete without a retrospective. We used a "Live Retro"  board to collect feedback from throughout the day (in little & often chunks). It asked for a few key data points:

- Mood Score: Never below 6/10 from any participant at any time during the day.
- What worked well: The venue. The lunch. The connection building. The sessions and how they were selected.
- It would be better if: Lightning talks had their own slot for all to attend, instead of alongside other unconference slots.
- Other comments: A great networking opportunity, and a chance to take a step back and evaluate other ways of working.

## **My main takeaways from the day**

- The Delivery Managers Community is alive and well and that there is a high calibre of people within government.
- Between us, we have the toolsets, experiences and collaborative mindset to solve the problems we all face on a day to day basis.
- We shouldn't let another 2 years pass before the next one.

A huge thank you to all those who organised this day, and I look forward to next time.
